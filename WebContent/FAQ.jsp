									You should be completely prepared for the session! You should start by preparing a complete plan from your side about all the things that you believe need to be addressed based on the customer’s query brief. 
Planning in advance helps the customer utilize the maximum worth of the session, have a great experience and in turn give good reviews. If you don’t share your plan, a lot of time will be wasted in understanding each other’s view points and the session will be a waste. For a good review, plan ahead!
</br>Here are a few key pointers to a great session:</br>
•	Don’t waste a lot of time on introductions, the customer already knows a lot about you through your profile.</br> 
•	Share your plan and listen to the customer’s plan to mutually decide on how the session should progress.</br>
•	Understand from the customer what he or she wants to focus on.</br>
•	Keep an idea of what is being discussed to help you answer any follow-up emails</br>
•	Keep track of the time</br>
•	Don’t think of addressing everything in one session. You might end up telling the customer everything but making him or her understand nothing!</br>

II.	After short introductions, the advisor gives a brief overview to the customer of how he wants to take the sessions, the customer gives his inputs and the session begins</br>
III.	The sessions continues for the designated time period, a reminder for the last remaining 10 minutes is issued</br>
IV.	Session ends after the designated time period and the customer is given a follow up email for any doubts or questions regarding the session.</br>
V.	Advisor receives a follow-up call from the Advisor Circuit Team.</br>

								 No, every session request does not have to be accepted. The service is flexible and you are free to dedicate as much time as you can to it. However we request you to take as many sessions possible. If none of the 6 time slots for a session request sent by the user suit you, you can send the user 3 time slots of your own convenience when you can hold the session. The user can then reply back with the suitable time slot from these 3 and the session can be conducted.

									The query brief is one of the most important ingredients to a great session! It helps not only the advisor understand what exactly your doubts are but also you to recognize your priority questions. It is the basis on which the advisor judges whether he or she can help you with your queries and plan a great session accordingly. 
The query brief needs to be to the point but comprehensive in terms of what needs you want the advisor to address; your introduction; your situation and your doubts.

b.	Type of Service</br>
c.	Mode of Communication</br>
Every advisor determines his or her session price for different types of service and modes of communication. We have no say in it! </br>
We don’t have discounts for sessions but if you plan to take multiple (greater than 6) sessions from the same advisor or if you’re a corporate looking to have sessions for your employees, we can offer a deal strictly on a case to case basis. Do contact us!

								 Once the session request sent by you to the advisor is confirmed by him or her and a day and time has been mutually agreed upon, you would be asked to pay for the session in order to confirm it. Advisor Circuit takes payment only through credit & debit cards. This is done via the PayPal Payment Gateway, which is an internationally secure gateway for online transactions!

								 You should be completely prepared for the session to get the best out of the precious time you have with your advisor! Start by preparing a complete plan at your end about all the things that you want to talk about and the queries you want the advisor to solve.  A previously written great query brief would be enormously helpful at this stage.

Planning in advance of the session helps you in maximally utilizing the entire worth of the session time and also helps your advisor understand your requirements better.
</br>Here are a few key pointers to a great session:</br>
•	Do not waste a lot of time on your introduction, your advisor already knows you through your query brief. </br>
•	Know your questions - Don’t waste time thinking</br>
•	Prioritize your questions - Address the important ones first</br>
•	Let the advisor know what you want to focus on</br>
•	Take notes!</br>
•	Keep taking note of the time.</br>
•	Don’t think of addressing everything in one session. You might talk about everything but understand nothing!

</br>III.	The sessions continues for the designated time period, a reminder for the last remaining 10 minutes is issued
</br>IV.	Session ends after the designated time period and the customer is given a follow up email for any doubts or questions regarding the session.
</br>V.	Customer receives a follow-up call from the Advisor Circuit Team and fills out a review for the session and advisor
